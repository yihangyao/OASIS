Scripts for dataset generation
---


This folder contains some example scripts for data collection via the [FSRL](https://github.com/liuzuxin/fsrl) package. The expert `trpo-lag` is well-tuned for many tasks with gradually changing target cost thresholds. Please follow the `FSRL` package instruction to install the dependencies.

You may also need to install `numba, matplotlib, tqdm` packages in order to use the data analysis and process scripts.
